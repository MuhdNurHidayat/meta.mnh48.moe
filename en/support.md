## Support MNH48

You could support Yaya, the owner of the website, in various ways.


### Why should I support you anyway?

I don't know. It's really up to you, I don't mind if you wouldn't support me, it's just that I'll be more motivated and do more different stuff if I have your support.

I'm a Malay translator for software, plugins, mods, webpages and documents. I'm also the core Malay translator for [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/), an open source infinite-world block sandbox game engine and game with survival and crafting, and selected mods and contents for Minetest. Besides that, I'm also helping development of some software, plugins, mods and documents in other ways such as debugging or reporting issues.

By supporting me, you show that you appreciate my work. It encourages me to spend more time to do more different stuff and keep on what I have been doing, including the translations and support the effort of global internationalization, to help more people understand more materials. It will also help me cover the costs of hosting my test servers, which I'm using for testing or compiling software, as no one cared about 32-bit Linux computers anymore and my main device is an old netbook from 2010 that has motherboard that only support 32-bit, so I need to use that server (which is 64-bit) to compile software that I want for 32-bit so that I could run them on my device. It will also make me able to resume operation of [Malay-specific Minetest server](https://sv.mnh48.com/) which is currently offline as I don't have enough fund to run.

Please note that you should support me only if you like what I've done so far or if you want to support the effort of global internationalization. Otherwise, you don't have to support me. :)


### What exactly is your current device?

It's a netbook provided by TM (Malaysian major Internet service provider) to my family back in 2010 for us subscribing to the secondary school student's internet plan with fastest internet offered at our housing area at the time, the Streamyx 1Mbps internet plan (ADSL), with the blazing fast 1Mbps download and 512kbps upload. Note that I have already moved out from that house due to family problem, but I take the netbook with me since it is kinda under my name (remember, it's a secondary school student internet plan, I'm the only one in school at that time in the family), and even my parents themselves had terminated the Streamyx subscription after ending the contract term as the price stayed as is when newer mobile data subscription with much faster speed had lower price. They're now using mobile data for the whole family but with speed of around 20Mbps, a large improvement from the Streamyx 1Mbps internet and cheaper too.

I use [Maybank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybank) for my banking needs because Maybank is the most reliable bank in Malaysia and they offer many different account types and card types, including credit, debit, prepaid, and charge cards. Maybank is also the sole issuer of American Express cards for Malaysian customers. Maybank has branches all over Malaysia, in all southeast Asia countries, and additionally in China, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, UK, US, Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, and UAE.

Do note that all bank cards issued in Malaysia, regardless issued by Maybank or other banks, are debit cards with contactless payment by regulation, there is no ATM-only bank cards or so-called "cash cards" in Malaysia anymore, and all card terminals in Malaysia uses both chip and NFC; magnetic strip cards don't work here.


#### Send Something

As a people who is into computer science and technology, and also a translator, I will appreciate if you send me something related to computer and languages. However, I will actually accept anything as long as it does not violate postal law and I won't need to pay for customs. I'm not paying for customs if the item you're sending to me get stuck in the customs office or import department.
